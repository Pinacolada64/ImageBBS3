How much RAM a program takes

Actually...

Types 1-2 are i. and i/
Type 3 is sub.
so outputting "i.sub." is misleading. Another modification to output correct
filename prefix:
3033 &"{pound}v7{f6}":c=a-2:poke53252,14:&"{f6}{light blue}Run{cyan}:

' 56 bytes

Actually Ryan, if you want to do something in i.main, see why it won't run a
program or module from a device/drive other than Image drive 5. I haven't
troubleshot that yet.
&,15,6,133 has something to do with it.

3032 any reason line 304 (define Image 1.2 variables) needs to be called?
3036 on-(c=3)goto [bypasses Device/Drive prompt]

i.t:

[rejected] SuperCPU stuff?:

3654 &,52,$34,3:on-(a%=.)goto3655:poke53370,0:&,52,$35,0
3655 return
3656 &,52,$34,3:on-(a%=.)goto3657:poke53371,0:&,52,$35,1
3657 return

This is a bit cleaner (Ray agreed):

3654 &,52,$34,3:ifa%thenpoke53370,0:&,52,$35,0
3655 return
3656 &,52,$34,3:ifa%thenpoke53371,0:&,52,$35,1
3657 return

I'll keep it in my local version. Also, why not put this in IM?

Remove last line of s.lightdefs (cursor movement)

designate a line in im that does

	a=abs(int(val(an$))):return

Larry:
[my confusion over his "dump" terminology]
The Mnt-L is not for displaying tr%. That is always displayed as you know. I added a function to Mnt-L to dump tr% to zero. One reason for that was because if a call comes in while the modem is disabled with the Mnt-R checkmark, it is held in the receive buffer and when you remove the Mnt-R checkmark, whatever is in the buffer gets picked up causing the bbs to connect and go to the hit backspace key. Since there is nobody online, the board will sit there for 6 minutes until tr% counts down to 0 then reset back to the idle screen.
A second reason for that function is even during normal operation, sometimes a real caller (or what appears to be a real caller) connects to the board and does nothing at the hit backspace prompt. If the sysop is around and sees it happen, he can dump tr% to 0 to clear the line and reset back to idle by moving the highlight on the lightbar to the Mnt position and hitting f7.

10/31/2020:
If `Mnt` right (_Modem Answer Disabled_) is active and a call comes in, bytes generated by the connect process are held in the RS232 receive buffer.

This seems like a bug. Seems to me the RS232 buffer head/tail pointer could be reset to clear the buffer. There is a routine in sub.modem for this.

s.detect files are for displaying different seq files depending on the mode detected at login. Ascii, ansi and cg.
The files are customizable.
As are many of the s.files.
If off, it shows the hard code detect mode in i.lo line 3564.
And by the way, this was existing code as I received it. All I did was add the generic s.detect files

I'm using tcpser with winvice 3.4 in Image 3.0 with Ray's updated ml files and have found that punter single and multi file transfers work as well as they do with BBS Server.  One issue though is that if both the sending and receiving sides are at 19200 or higher, Image Term 3.0 cannot upload or download from the UD or UX of Image 3.0.  Change either side to 9600 and transfers are fine. I have not yet tried other term programs at 19200 or above.
