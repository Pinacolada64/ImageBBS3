== Convert a 2.0 System

NOTE: This is the recommended way of converting 2.0 to 3.0.
Other ways may work but have not been tested.
Since you are already running Image 2.0, keep the same Image drive assignments for the 3.0 upgrade.

****
The file `im` line `3074` is preconfigured to run from drive 0.
This is the default partition on most drives.

NOTE: If running on a Lt. Kernal and your boot LU is not LU0, change the `0` in line `3074` to the number of your boot LU.
****

. Make a complete backup of all your Image 2.0 drives.
. Copy `bd.data` from your programs drive to your Etcetera Disk.
. Remove all your 2.0 boot and program files from your Program Disk.
. Copy all the files from IMAGE 3.0 D1 to your Program Disk.
. Copy `bd.data` from the Etcetera Disk to the Program Disk, but rename it to `d.data`.
. Copy `e.lightdefs`, `e.lightbar` and `e.ecs.main` from IMAGE 3.0 D2 to your Etcetera Disk, replacing the existing files.
. Remove all the Image 2.0 `s.*` files from your System Disk.

CAUTION: What if you've written custom board entry files or login screens?

[start=8]
. Copy all the `s.*` files from IMAGE 3.0 D2 to your System Disk.

****
If you want to run the "`Today in History`" login module in 3.0, copy all the `today.*` files from IMAGE 3.0 D2 to your Etcetera Disk.

. When prompted, type kbd:[3] `Convert a 2.0 system`.

. Image 3.0 will perform all the necessary tasks of converting your 2.0 to 3.0 and will end up at the idle screen.

NOTE: Since the 3.0 modem configuration is different from 2.0, Image BBS won't communicate with your virtual modem yet.
You can fix this in a later step.

[start=6]
. Log on to your BBS from the console.
. Type kbd:[IM] to go to the Configuration Editor.

Continue to the <<setting-up.adoc#_shared_image_bbs_3_0_setup,Shared Image BBS 3.0 Setup>> section.

. Configure your modem.

. Configure any items not already configured in `Misc. Features`.

. Go into the `Logon Editor` and configure your `Login Mods` (login modules).
There is a Help function which will explain how to do it.

. Configure your new `Maint Mods` (Nightly AutoMaintenance modules).

. Configure your `Lightbar Defs` (lightbar defaults).

. When back at the IM Configuration Editor, select the option for `Base Editors`.

****
This takes you to the menu page that used to be called by the kbd:[SM] command in 2.0.
You shouldnâ€™t have to do anything here, but you can look around if you want to.
****

When done, use the `Quit` option to go back to the Configuration Editor.
Then `Quit` from there back to the Main Prompt.

20. Enter kbd:[NF] to go to the News files and configure any news files needing to be edited, added or configured.
(`n.$Welcome!`, perhaps?)
kbd:[Q]uit back to the Main Prompt when done.

21. Type kbd:[GF] to go to the General Files section.
Notice that nothing is configured.
You will need to reconfigure your GF section due to the incompatibility between 3.0 and 2.0 file formats.

#TODO:# Converter should be possible...
