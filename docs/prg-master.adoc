### `im` Subroutines

Some routines are simply needed too often by too many modules to justify placing them in every single module.
Subroutines are a programmer's greatest friend.
The core `im` file contains many subroutines which you will find basic to your application or module's needs.
Be sure to read the xref:prg-programming-etiquette.adoc#programming-etiquette[Programming Etiquette] section for help when deciding where to place a new routine you create.

### `sub.*` Module Jump Table

Files with a `sub.` prefix contain routines which are used often, but to save memory and avoid code repetition, are separated from the main `im` module.
