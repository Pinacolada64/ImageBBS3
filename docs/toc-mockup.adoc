== Image BBS 3.0 Sysop Guide

:toc: left

NOTE: This is a mock-up of the in-progress _Image BBS 3.0 Sysop Guide_ (using content from the _Image BBS 1.2b Sysop Guide_) to illustrate where sections could belong in the finished manual.
A short idea of who wrote which sections or what information goes in new sections goes here too, for team feedback.

NOTE: It would be _really_ nice to use conditional includes (which ASCIIdoctor can do!) of sysop-level commands/chapters and be able to output an _Image BBS 3.0 User`'s Guide_ with only user-level commands.

NOTE: I have decided to remove gerunds (nouns/verbs ending in '`-ing`') from most headings whenever it makes sense ( _e.g._ change Reading -> Read, Viewing -> View, Editing -> Edit).
It`'s easier to read, and easier to find using search functions.
An argument for this: https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2013/10/12/death-of-the-gerund-in-technical-documentation/

NOTE: I vacillate between retaining the "`headline text`" style of Image BBS`'s menu entries in headings, and converting to only initial caps--so for now there`'s a mixture of both.
Send help.

Al wrote these.

== Product Information

=== Why a New Version?
=== What`'s New

==== Sysop Features

// Jay Theriot runs this

Online documentation hosted there, someday.
Having https://www.github.io available for this preview helps immensely in the meantime.

Ryan is writing these.

Only trouble is "`for profit`" phrasing.

==== RS232 Interface Type

=== Shared Image BBS 3.0 Setup

Since a lot of steps are shared between different upgrade options, I chose to add this "`Shared Image BBS 3.0 Setup Steps`" section to cut down on a few pages of duplicate instructions.
#TODO#: Verify the steps are in fact word-for-word duplicates.

=== Introducing the `IM` Configuration Editor

#TODO#: Cross-reference more in-depth `IM` chapter.

==== GGlabs GLink232-LT

SwiftLink clone

#TODO#: This will incorporate Larry`'s docs plus re-use additional information in the expanded 1.2b docs.
Give URL of GGlabs order page.
This needs work to be fully converted to ASCIIdoctor still.

IMPORTANT: Make these the first 2 chapters.
Maintenance and configuration are really important sysop tasks.

NOTE: The commands listed in these headings are just temporary.
I`'m checking them against `s.menu *` files to make sure I don`'t forget something.
