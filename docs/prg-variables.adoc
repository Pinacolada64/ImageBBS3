## Variables

// From Image 1.2 Programmer's Reference Guide, with slight rewording edits:

Within Image BBS, there are certain variables which can be considered "`reserved.`" 
This does not mean that you cannot use them, __per se__, but that they can only be used for specific purposes:

* Some variables may be used any time, but have a specific purpose.
* Some variables can be used with certain subsystems, but not with others.
* Some variables may be used anywhere, but change continually.

This is explained in detail in the following paragraphs.

An example of a variable used for a specific purpose is `na$`.
This variable is used to print the handle of the user online.
Storing something for a module in this variable would cause an undesirable effect (modifying the user's handle). 
Basically, these types of variables are used to control system statistics and are best left alone, only to be used to output information.

Some variables are used as interfaces between the BASIC and ML, an example being `pl`.
Setting `pl` to `0` will cause all user input to be in the form of upper- and lowercase characters.
When you set `pl` in BASIC, it causes the ML input routines to accept both uppercase and lowercase characters.

The main variables that can be used sometimes are arrays.
Depending on which subsystem you are in, the arrays may or may not be in use.
If they are not in use, it is safe to use them.
The only exceptions to this is `st()`, `dv%()` and `tt$()`. 

* `st()` holds the Board Activity Register stats; changing the values of this array should be reserved for updating the BAR stats.

* `dv%()` is the system device designator.
Altering this will change the device accessed by the system.

* `tt$()` cannot be used in a module that calls the editor, unless you want to edit existing text in that array.
All text stored in the editor is put into `tt$()`.

Some variables are intended to continually change.
These include variables that will print text to the screen and modem, as well as variables that form links between the BASIC and ML portions of the program.
Examples are `a$` and `an$`:

* When used in conjunction with `&`, the value of `a$` will be printed to the screen and modem.

* All responses entered at a prompt will be stored in `an$`.

These variables have a set purpose, but are intended to change.

### Type

`BBS`: this is a BBS statistic or BBS-maintained variable, it could be saved to `e.data`.

`User`: this is a user statistic, saved to `u.config`.

### Write

// icon:check[] in the _Read_ column indicates you can get its value.

icon:check[] in the _Write_ column indicates you can assign a value from BASIC.

====
WARNING: If there isn't a check mark in the _Write_ column, the variable is maintained by the BBS ML or BASIC modules.
User data corruption or other unwanted side effects may occur if this variable is reassigned.

### Purpose

////
if a variable is read-only or write-only, don't need *Read* or *write* listed in "purpose" column

### Strings

`b$`-`z$` are work variables used throughout the BBS by different subsections.
They are available for use and may be read and written freely.

Some specific information about certain variables is outlined below.
