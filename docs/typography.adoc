:experimental: // enable kbd:[] macro

== Typography Notes

There are several conventions used in this manual.

_Italic text_ represents a variable, or some text supplied by the user in response to a prompt.

*Bold text* represents #FIXME#.

Letters or text enclosed in rounded, shaded squares such as kbd:[T], kbd:[Ctrl], or kbd:[f1] represent keys on the Commodore 64 keyboard.
They generally are either options, or should be pressed, during a series of instructions in the manual.

== Latin Junk

Because I'm such a nerd:

* _i.e._ is short for _id est_, meaning "`that is to say,`" or "`in other words.`"

* _e.g._ is short for _exemplī grātiā_, meaning "`for example.`"
