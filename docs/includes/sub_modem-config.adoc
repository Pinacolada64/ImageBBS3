. The file `sub.modem` is customized for use with BBS Server using DTR as carrier detect.
Line `60080` contains `print#131,chr$(27)`. This is the Hayes AT escape character (set to Escape to avoid BBS Server hanging up when it sees ``+++``).

NOTE: If you're using a virtual modem such as `tcpser` and need to use the Hayes escape sequence instead of DTR hangup, you may need to change the 27 (`Escape`) to 43 (`+`) and add `ats2=43` (setting the Hayes escape character to `+`) to your modem init string.
