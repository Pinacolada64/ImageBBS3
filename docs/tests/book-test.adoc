=== Acknowledgments

I`'d like to thank the Academy...

== Introduction

```
print"hello, world"
```

== In the Beginning

[quote, Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker`'s Guide to the Galaxy]
In the beginning, the Universe was created. This has made countless people very unhappy, and was widely regarded as a bad move.

=== The Sysadmin Problem

Get stuff out of my head and onto paper in case I am ever hit by a bus.

== Product Information

=== Why a New Version?

=== What`'s New

==== Sysop Features

==== User Features

==== Programming Features

=== Support Channels

==== NISSA BBSes

List them, addresses. Mention cbbsoutpost.

==== Social Media

Facebook, Brent's forum, Google Hangouts?

==== imagebbs.org

// Jay Theriot runs this

Online documentation hosted there, someday.
Having https://www.github.io available for this preview helps immensely in the meantime.

Ryan is writing these.

=== License, No Warranty

MIT license? https://mit-license.org/
Only trouble is "`for profit`" phrasing.

// == Supported Hardware

== Modem/Telnet Bridge Setup

=== Telnet BBSes and Bridge Software

==== `tcpser 1.1rc1`

(((RS232 bridge, tcpser 1.1rc1)))

From documentation:

____
`tcpser` turns a PC serial port into an emulated Hayes compatible modem that uses TCP/IP for incoming and outgoing connections.
It can be used to allow older applications and systems designed for modem use to operate on the Internet.
`tcpser` supports all standard Hayes commands, and understands
extended and vendor proprietary commands (though it does not implement many of them).
`tcpser` can be used for both inbound and outbound connections.
____

#TODO#: mention jbrain GitHub repo since FozzTexx and geneb fixes are in 1.1rc1

==== `tcpser4j`

(((RS232 bridge, tcpser4j))) ((tcpser4j)) is

Advantages:

* Play DTMF tones
* Play sound on connect
* Run multiple virtual modems in a single instance

=== BBS Server

(((RS232 bridge, BBS Server)))

BBS Server is a graphical program that does many of the same things as tcpser.

=== Virtual Serial Port Emulator

(((RS232 bridge, VSPE))) is a commercial program. (Al)

// #TODO# any others?

=== Designate Drives

=== Copy Files

(((im)))

IMPORTANT: Copy `im` to Program disk for error recovery.

Two types, user port and expansion (cartridge) port.

=== Shared Image BBS 3.0 Setup

Since a lot of steps are shared between different upgrade options, I chose to add this "`Shared Image BBS 3.0 Setup Steps`" section to cut down on a few pages of duplicate instructions.
#TODO#: Verify the steps are in fact word-for-word duplicates.

=== Introducing the `IM` Configuration Editor

// concealed index entry
(((configuration editor, IM)))

#TODO#: Cross-reference more in-depth `IM` chapter.

==== GGlabs GLink232-LT

SwiftLink clone

#TODO#: This will incorporate Larry`'s docs plus re-use additional information in the expanded 1.2b docs.
Give URL of GGlabs order page.
This needs work to be fully converted to ASCIIdoctor still.
