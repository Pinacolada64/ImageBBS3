## Running Modules

Like Image 1._x_ (1._x_ stands for 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2) BBS before it, Image 3.0 can run modules from the main prompt by typing kbd:[R].
However, there are more types of modules available in this version of Image.

### Image 1._x_ Emulation Mode [[emulation-mode]]

When kbd:[R] is typed from the main prompt, Image checks to see whether you are 
in Image 1._x_ emulation mode (when the left side of `Em3` on the 
lightbar is checked).
If this is enabled, an "`emulation layer`" loads, which uses Image 1._x_`'s `im` line numbers. You can then run plus files for those older versions instead.

If Image 1._x_ emulation mode is disabled, you can load Image 3.0 `i` modules. There are several types of these, with differing filename prefixes and starting line numbers. The following section discusses the additional prompts specifying options for which module type to run.

### Command Classes

First, you are prompted for the _command class_. A number, 3-5, is required here. The command class specifies which module type will be loaded, and which line number it starts executing at.

.Module Command Classes
[options="header,autowidth"]
|====================
| Class | Prefix | Starting line 
| 3     | `i.`   | `3000` 
| 4     | `i/`   | `4000` 
| 5     | `sub.` | `60000` 
|====================

### Device,Drive Prompt

Next, you are prompted for the device and drive to run the module from.

- Typing a single number from 1-6 specifies one of the six Image system disks.
Depending on the Image 1._x_ emulation status, system disk 5 is either your `i` module (Image 3.0) or `+` file (using Image 1._x_ emulation) disk.

- You can also type the device number, a comma, and the drive number to run a module from a specific device and drive. Devices 8-29 and drives 0-254 [TODO: check this] are supported.

TIP: In Xetec's Lt.Kernal hard drive DOS terminology, the drive number refers to the _Logical Unit_ or LU; in Creative Micro Designs`' (CMD`'s) DOS, it is the _partition_).

### Value of Variable

Each type of module uses a different variable within the BASIC code to control which subroutine in the module executes. You are prompted for the value of the variable here.

.Module Variables
[options="header,autowidth"]
|====================
| Class | Variable 
| 3     | `mm`       
| 4     | `lm`       
| 5     | `im`       
|====================

TODO: There is a module jump table in the _Image 3.0 Programmer`'s Reference Guide_.

If there is no DOS error, the module should execute.

TIP: A `file not found` DOS error is written to the system error log (`e.errlog`, viewable with kbd:[VF]) as a `load error`.

.Module Types
[options="header,autowidth"]
|====================
| Prefix    |  Starting line | Purpose 
| `+.`      |  1     | Image 1._x_ plus file
| `i.`      |  3000  | Image 3.0 module
| `i/`      |  4000  | Image 3.0 sub-module
| `i.XX/YY` |  3000  | Image 3.0 sub-module YY of XX
| `i/lo.`   |  3000  | Idle command 
| `i/lo/`   |  4000  | Automaint module
| `i/lo-`   |  4500  | Login module  
| `i/XX.YY` |  4000  | Sub-module YY of XX
| `sub.*`   |  60000 | Common BBS code called by various files
