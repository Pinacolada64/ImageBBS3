.Option Lists
To show when options are mutually exclusive (there can be only one option chosen from a group), the following notation is used:

[ _option 1_ | _option 2_ | _option 3_ ]

means that of the three options presented, option 1 _or_ option 2 _or_ option 3 is saved in that position in the file.
