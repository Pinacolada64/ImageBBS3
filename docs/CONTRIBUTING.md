CONTRIBUTING.md

This documentation is written in an extended form of markdown called ASCIIdoc. Home page: https://asciidoctor.org/

The markdown editor used is AsciiDocFX. Home page: https://asciidocfx.com/

A single file with (admittedly slightly esoteric) markup can generate multiple output formats.

It's suggested you generate the .html version (which I think looks the best right now, until I figure out nicer looking PDF stylesheets).

I plan on using sections from the Image 1.2b documentation to save some effort. Still learning about ASCIIdoc, pull requests encouraged!
